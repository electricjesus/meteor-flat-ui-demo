# Meteor Flat UI Demo

This is a demo for my fork of the [Meteor Flat UI Meteorite](https://www.github.com/electricesus/meteor-flat-ui/) package.

### Notes

As you can see, the package `meteor-flat-ui` (originally by Erik P.) was not added automatically via Atmosphere but instead manually as a git-sourced package. See `smart.json` for more details on how.

### Usage

* Have [Meteor](http://www.meteor.com/) and [Meteorite](https://www.github.com/oortcloud/meteorite) installed.
* Clone this repo.
* Run `mrt` inside the cloned repo / project directory.
* ????
* Profit!
